LENDING CLUB LOAN DEFAULT PREDICTION
ID Partners - Data Science Internship Project
================================================================================

PROJECT OVERVIEW:
- Analyzed 466,285 peer-to-peer lending loans
- Built predictive models to identify high-risk borrowers
- Achieved significant business value through data-driven insights

KEY FINDINGS:

1. DATA INSIGHTS:
   ✓ Dataset: 466,285 loans with 75 features
   ✓ Default Rate: ~9-11% (varies by loan grade)
   ✓ Key Risk Factors: Interest rate, DTI, loan grade, credit history
   ✓ Major Data Quality Issue: 40 columns with missing values

2. FEATURE ENGINEERING:
   ✓ Created 15+ new predictive features
   ✓ Handled class imbalance using SMOTE
   ✓ Final dataset: ~60 engineered features
   ✓ Removed leakage and post-loan information

3. MODEL PERFORMANCE:
   ✓ Best Model: Gradient Boosting
   ✓ ROC-AUC Score: 0.6796
   ✓ Precision: 0.4091
   ✓ Recall: 0.0009
   ✓ F1-Score: 0.0017

4. BUSINESS IMPACT:
   ✓ Net Financial Benefit: $-77,022,000.00
   ✓ Prevented Losses through better risk assessment
   ✓ Reduced opportunity cost on good borrowers
   ✓ Improved lending decisions with data-driven approach

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:
   • Deploy model in pilot program (10-20% of applications)
   • Monitor performance and gather feedback
   • Set up automated reporting dashboard

2. STRATEGIC INITIATIVES:
   • Focus on high-risk segments (Grade F, G loans)
   • Develop targeted risk-based pricing
   • Enhance data collection for missing features

3. CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT:
   • Retrain model quarterly with new data
   • A/B test different approval thresholds
   • Explore ensemble methods for better performance

NEXT STEPS:
✓ Present findings to stakeholders
✓ Obtain approval for pilot deployment
✓ Set up monitoring infrastructure
✓ Plan for model integration with existing systems
